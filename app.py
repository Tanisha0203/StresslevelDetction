# libraries : 
# flask : for frontend
#  dlib: Face detection and facial landmark prediction.
#  cv2 (OpenCV): Video capture, image processing, and display of results.
#  Keras: Emotion classification using a pre-trained model.
#  imutils: Image resizing utilities.  Resizes the input frame, ensuring the width doesnâ€™t exceed 500 pixels while maintaining the aspect ratio.
#  scipy: Euclidean distance calculation.
#  numpy: Numerical and array operations, normalization, and scaling.
# matplotlib= Matplotlib is a plotting library, often used for visualizing data, including plotting the training and validation loss/accuracy curves of your machine learning model.
# tensorflow = TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning library,  training, and deploying deep learning models (like the one in your stress detection system)



# Model and Data:
# shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat: This is a pre-trained model for detecting 68 facial landmarks. It's used with dlib's shape_predictor to predict the facial landmarks in the detected face.


# _mini_XCEPTION.102-0.66.hdf5: This is the pre-trained Keras model used for emotion classification. The model predicts emotions based on facial expressions, such as "happy", "sad", "angry", etc.
